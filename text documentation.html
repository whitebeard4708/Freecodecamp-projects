      <h3>Python Tutorial</h3>
      <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented,
         and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum
         during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under
         the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough
         understanding on Python programming language.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This tutorial is designed for software programmers who need to learn
         Python programming language from scratch.</p>
      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming
        terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages
        is a plus.</p>
    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Overview'>
      <header><h1>Overview</h1></header>
      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented
         scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses
         English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation,
         and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> − Python is processed at
           runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program
           before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.<p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> − You can actually sit at a
          Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your
          programs.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> − Python supports
           Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates
           code within objects.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> − Python is a
           great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the
           development of a wide range of applications from simple text
           processing to WWW browsers to games.</p></li>

      <header><h1>Basic Syntax</h1></header>
      <p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.
         However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>
      <h3>First Python program</h3>
      <p>Let us execute programs in different modes of programming.</p>
      <p id='italic'>Interactive Mode Programming</p>
      <p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter
         brings up the following prompt.</p>
<code>$ python
Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)
[GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2

    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Variable_Types'>
      <header><h1>Variable Types</h1></header>
      <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
         This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in
         memory.</p>
      <p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates
         memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
         Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can
         store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
      <h3>Assigning Values to Variables</h3>
      <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory
         space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value
         to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
      <p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable
         and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in
          the variable. For example</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string

print counter
print miles
print name</code>
      <p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to <i>counter,
         miles,</i> and <i>name</i> variables, respectively. This produces
         the following result</p>
<code>100
1000.0
John</code>
      <h3>Multiple Assignment</h3>
      <p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables
         simultaneously. For example</p>
<code>a = b = c = 1</code>
      <p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all three
         variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also
         assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example</p>
<code>a,b,c=1,2,'John'</code>
      <p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to
         variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value
         "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>
      <h3>Standart Data Types</h3>
      <p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a
         person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is
         stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data
         types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the
         storage method for each of them.</p>
      <p>Python has five standard data types</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Numbers</p></li>
        <li><p>Strings</p></li>
        <li><p>Lists</p></li>
        <li><p>Tuples</p></li>
        <li><p>Dictionary</p></li>

    <section class='main-section' id='Basic_Operators'>
      <header><h1>Basic Operators</h1></header>
      <p>Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.</p>
      <p>Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands
         and + is called operator.</p>
      <h3>Types of Operator</h3>
      <p>Python language supports the following types of operators.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Arithmetic Operators</p></li>
        <li><p>Comparison (Relational) Operators</p></li>
        <li><p>Assignment Operators</p></li>

    <section class='main-section' id='Decision_Making'>
      <header><h1>Decision Making</h1></header>
      <p>Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while
         execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to
         the conditions.</p>
      <p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE
         or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and
         which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.</p>
      <p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure
         found in most of the programming languages</p>

      <p>Python programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and
         <b>non-null</b> values as TRUE, and if it is either <b>zero</b> or
         <b>null</b>, then it is assumed as FALSE value.</p>

    <section class='main-section' id='Loops'>
      <header><h1>Loops</h1></header>
      <p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement
         in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
         There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code
         several number of times.</p>
      <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow
         for more complicated execution paths.</p>
      <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of
         statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop
         statement.</p>
      <img class='mid-block' src='https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/loop_architecture.jpg'
            alt='loop'>
      <p>Python programming language provides following types of loops to
         handle looping requirements.</p>
      <table>

        <tr>
          <td style='text-align: center'>2</td>
          <td><b>for loop</b><br>
            Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates
            the code that manages the loop variable.</td>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>
      <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence.
         When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created
         in that scope are destroyed.</p>
      <p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following

         <tr>
           <td style='text-align: center'>2</td>
           <td><b>continue statement</b><br>

    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Numbers'>
      <header><h1>Numbers</h1></header>
      <p>Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types,
         means that changing the value of a number data type results in a
         newly allocated object.</p>
      <p>Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example</p>
<code>var1 = 1
var2 = 2</code>
      <p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the
       <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the del statement is</p>
<code>del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]</code>
      <p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the
         <b>del</b> statement. For example</p>
<code>del var
del var_a, var_b</code>
      <p>Python supports four different numerical types</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>int (signed integers)</b> − They are often called just integers or
           ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>long (long integers)</b> − TAlso called longs, they are integers
          of unlimited size, written like integers and followed by an uppercase or
          lowercase L.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>float (floating point real values)</b> − Also called floats,
           they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point
           dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in
           scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10
           (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).</p></li>
        <li><p><b>complex (complex numbers)</b> − are of the form a + bJ, where
           a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1
           (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a,
           and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in
           Python programming.</p></li>

      <p>Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create
         them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single

         assigning a value to a variable. For example</p>
<code>var1 = 'Hello World!'
var2 = "Python Programming"</code>
      <h3>Accesing Values in Strings</h3>
      <p>Python does not support a character type; these are treated as
        strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.</p>
      <p>To access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with
         the index or indices to obtain your substring. For example</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

var1 = 'Hello World!'
var2 = "Python Programming"

print "var1[0]: ", var1[0]
print "var2[1:5]: ", var2[1:5]</code>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<code>var1[0]:  H
var2[1:5]:  ytho</code>

    <section class='main-section' id='Lists'>
      <header><h1>Lists</h1></header>
      <p>The most basic data structure in Python is the <b>sequence</b>. Each element
         of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first
         index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.</p>
      <p>Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones
         are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.</p>
      <p>There are certain things you can do with all sequence types. These
         operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and
         checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in functions
         for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and
         smallest elements.</p>
      <h3>Python lists</h3>
      <p>The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can
         be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square
         brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need
         not be of the same type.</p>
      <p>Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated
         values between square brackets. For example<p>
<code>list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]</code>
      <p>Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be
         sliced, concatenated and so on.</p>
      <h3>Accessing values in lists</h3>
      <p>To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along
         with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.
         For example</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];
print "list1[0]: ", list1[0]
print "list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5]</code>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<code>list1[0]:  physics
list2[1:5]:  [2, 3, 4, 5]</code>

    <section class='main-section' id='Tuples'>
      <header><h1>Tuples</h1></header>
      <p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are
         sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and
         lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples
         use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.</p>
      <p>Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated
         values. Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between
         parentheses also. For example</p>
<code>tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";</code>
      <p>The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing</p>
<code>tup1 = ()</code>
      <p>To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a
         comma, even though there is only one value</p>
<code>tup1 = (1,)</code>
      <p>Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced,
         concatenated, and so on.</p>
      <h3>Accessing values in tuples</h3>
      <p>To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along
         with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.
         For example</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 );
print "tup1[0]: ", tup1[0];
print "tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5];</code>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<code>tup1[0]:  physics
tup2[1:5]:  (2, 3, 4, 5)</code>

    <section class='main-section' id='Dictionary'>
      <header><h1>Dictionary</h1></header>
      <p>Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are
         separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces.
         An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly
         braces, like this: {}.</p>
      <p>Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The
         values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an
         immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>
      <h3>Accessing values in dictionary</h3>
      <p>To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square
         brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a
         simple example</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
print "dict['Name']: ", dict['Name']
print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age']</code>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<code>dict['Name']:  Zara
dict['Age']:  7</code>
      <p>If we attempt to access a data item with a key, which is not part of
         the dictionary, we get an error as follows</p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/python

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
print "dict['Alice']: ", dict['Alice']</code>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result</p>
<code>dict['Alice']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 4, in <module>
      print "dict['Alice']: ", dict['Alice'];
KeyError: 'Alice'</code>
