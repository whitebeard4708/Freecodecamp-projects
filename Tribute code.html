      <h2>Early life<hr style='margin-top: -5px'></h2>
      <p>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was born in Milan, Ohio,
        and grew up in Port Hugon, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of
        Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. and Nancy Matthews Elliott. He only attended school for a few months
        and was instead taught by his mother. Much of his education came from reading and experimenting.</p>
      <p>Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed
         to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around
         the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by
         a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the
         train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he
         modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train,
         lifted him by the ears.</p>
      <p>Edison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and
         business declined. Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit,
         and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway
         at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He was held responsible for a near collision.
         He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.</p>
      <p>Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants,
         he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.This began
         Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These
         talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest
         publicly traded companies in the world.</p>

      <h2>Marriage and Family<hr style='margin-top: -5px'></h2>
      <p>On December 25, 1871, at the age of twenty-four, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884),
         whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:
         Marion Estelle Edison, Thomas Alva Edison Jr.,William Leslie Edison. <p>
      <p>On February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947)
         in Akron, Ohio.[29] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua
         Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together: Madeleine Edison,
         Charles Edison, Theodore Miller Edison.
      <h2>Death<hr style='margin-top: -5px'></h2>
      <p>Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, "Glenmont" in Llewellyn Park in
         West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben
         officiated at the funeral;Edison is buried behind the home.</p>
      <p>Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit.
         Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly
         after his death, as a memento.[107] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.
         Mina died in 1947.</p>
